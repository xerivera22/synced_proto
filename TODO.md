# TODO

- [x] Replace password field eye icons with eye slash variants on Teacher and Student registration forms while keeping clicks toggling visibility.
- [x] Standardize document titles across all pages so browser tabs show only "SyncED".
- [x] Redirect users to the role selection screen after successful registration for all roles (student, teacher, parent, admin).
- [x] Tighten footer spacing on admin and teacher login pages to reduce excess gaps while preserving readability.
- [x] Build an admin registration page; wire it into navigation and routing.
